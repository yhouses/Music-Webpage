      Music has alwas been a monument in human history. It has been a way to release messages and make out of the ordinary sound that can inspire hundreds.
      Music has always been a way for people to liberate themselves and it has worked it's way into political, social, as well as religous clauses. With this new
      infatuation of this current generation of ressurecting some classics, it's important we acknowledge the music from the past and see it's influence in today's music industry.
