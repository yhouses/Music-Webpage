      Music has been a monument in human history. It has been a way to release messages and make out of the ordinary sound that can inspire hundreds.
      Music has always been a way for people to liberate themselves and it has worked it's way into political, social, as well as religious clauses. With this new
      infatuation of this current generation of resurrecting some classics, it's important we acknowledge the power of music, which is what
	  John Roberts, Joel Rosenman, Artie Kornfield, and Michael Lang wanted to do. With all the chaos occurring at
	  that time, they just wanted "three days of peace and music". They also wanted to raise enough money from this
	  event to construct a recording studio in the town of Woodstock.</br> <br>This festival was a huge 
	  success since about 400,000 people attended this festival and it is still continued today.
	  Musical masterpieces were created at the festival and it had a huge elevation in the rates of rock lovers.
	  This festival is one of the most pivotal moments in music history. Though many famous artists and bands
	did not participate in this monumental festival, the lineup was still incredible, especially with Jimi Hendrix closing the festival.</p>

	<h2>The Performance That Made History</h2>
	<img src="hendrix.jpg" alt="hendrix" class="b" style="float:right"> <!--Hendrix performed at Woodstock and made history with his star-spangled banner rendition-->
	
	<p>Jimi Hendrix was the closing headline of the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Unfortunately, due to
	unpredicted rains that occurred the night before, many of the festival participants headed back to their
	previous locations. Only a percentage of the original audience stayed for the unforgettable performance that
	was greatly delivered. In this time, the Vietnam War was happening, which spiked the hippie era, in which
	people were advocating for peace and the return of our USA troops. Hendrix decided to incorporate this
	controversial message into his performance. Thus, the big uproar it received. With his own rendition of the
	Star-spangled banner, he created a clear visual all with the help of his guitar. With this traditional, 
	patriarchal tune that has been idolized in the minds of many, he showed the pain, fear, and violence that
	this war was causing. He spoke for many with this performance and in this performance, was he labeled as 'the greatest guitarist player to exist'.

  <li>Santana, a psychedelic jam band from San Francisco that incorporated Latin and African polyrhythms into blues-rock, was one of the least-known acts at Woodstock. It was added to the festival mainly because the manager Bill Graham, also the most powerful concert promoter in the country, 
  forced them onto the bill.He was also high on mescaline and was hallucinating all throughout his Woodstock
  performance</li>
